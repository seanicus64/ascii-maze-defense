tiles are two chars wide, one high
punctuation are towers, alpha are enemies
enemies go from left edge of screen to right
when they get to the right, you lose one life
when your lives go to zero, you lose
different waves
different enemy types.  each with different speeds
    1,2,3,4,5 = how many ticks
